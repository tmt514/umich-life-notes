# Graph Eigenvalues

## Linear-algebraic preliminaries

Let $$M$$ be $$p\times p$$ real symmetric matrix. $$\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_p$$ are real eigenvalues.

## Counting walks in graphs

Let $$G$$ graph (unoriented, loops and multiple edges are allowed) on the vertex set $$\{ 1, 2, \cdots, p\}$$. Let $$A(G)$$ be the adjacency matrix of $$G$$.

### Key observation

> **Success** Number of walks of length $$l$$ from $$i$$ to $$j$$ $$= (M^l)_{ij}$$.

Use multiplication rule we get 

> **Success** Number of marked closed walks of length $$l$$ in $$G$$ $$=tr(M^l) = \sum_k \lambda_{k}^l$$.
