# âœŽ 0-4. Positive or Negative

You are given two __nonzero__ real numbers $$a, b$$ expressed in scientific notation. You'll need to write a program to determine whether the product $$ab$$ is positive or negative.

## Input
Two numbers $$a, b$$.

## Output

Output `positive` if their product is positive, or `negative` otherwise.

## Technical Specification

* $$0 < |a|, |b| \le 10^{10000}$$.
* Both numbers will be in the form "$$c$$`e`$$d$$", or simply "$$c$$" if the exponent part is zero.
* The coefficient $$c$$ is a floating number with at most four digits after the decimal, and $$1\le |c|<10$$.
* The exponent $$d$$ will be an integer in the range $$-10000\le d\le 10000$$, it may or may not have a plus sign.
