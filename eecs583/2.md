# Lecture 2: 2015-09-16

## Announcements
* Introduce TA.
* No Midterm, the scores are distributed into HW and projects.

## Control Flow Analysis

* Basic Block.
* Execution $$\rightarrow$$ Dynamic control flow
    * branch prediction
* static control flow (Compiler)
    * not executing the program
* Control flow analysis
    * Determining properties of the program branch structure

Organize structures, make smart decisions.

## Basic Block (BB)

* Defn: a sequence of consecutive operations in which flow of control enters at the beginning and leaves at the end without halt or possibility of branching except at the end.
* If one operation is executed in a BB, they all are.

### Finding BB's
