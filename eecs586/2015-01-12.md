  * `the` rank 1, 6.18%
  * `I` rank 11, 1.17%
  * `you` rank 16, 0.83%
  * `he` rank 9, 1.27%
  * `she` rank 17, 0.7%
  * `war` $$\approx$$ 3* `peace`
  * `dog` $$\approx$$ 2* `cat`
* $$i$$-th most likely word occurs $$\approx \frac1i$$ times as often as most likely word.

Heavy tail distribution <=> Zipf's law distribution

Suppose that the key obey Zipf's $$1/i$$ Law, that is,
$$p_1, \cdots, p_n $$
with $$p_i / p_1 = 1/i$$. What are the probabilities?

The expected number of item examined:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n i\times (p_i/i) = np_1 =\Theta \left( \frac{n}{\log n} \right)$$

With Zipf's $$1/i^2$$, we'll have $$\Theta(\log n)$$. With $$1/i^3$$ we will have $$\Theta(1)$$.

Money saves time, caching saves cash.

## Move-to-front

Once get requested, move this key to the front.

## Keep-track-of-counts

Sort the requested by counts. This require linear extra space.

## Transposition

Have 1 position forward.

## Analysis

What is the asymptotic probability item $$j$$ is in front of $$i$$.
